- [[Changelog]]
	- Disclaimer: there were 1500+ tracked changes to the game for Update 10. We’ve tried to include absolutely everything we can below with regard to them, and had to summarise smaller changes to fit within the word count. Any oversights are entirely accidental and not intentional.

	- [[Western Front]]
		- Added [[Sainte-Marie-du-Mont]] v2
	- [[Metagame]]
		- Removed [[Resource]] cost from [[Vehicle]] roster [[Spawn]]s
			- Vehicles that are automatically spawned will no longer consume resources. This is designed to remove the uncontrollable Fuel cost to the Commander, to create greater strategic impact on vehicles spawned and resource handling.
		- [[Resource node]] provide a flat rate income of +10 per 60 [[Second]]s per [[Resource node]]
			- Based on feedback from the community, the additional gain of resource income that came with the control of enemy sectors was tipping the scale too far in one direction, resulting in a steamroll.
		- Change to an [ambient resource gain]([[Ambient resource generation]]) of +10 per 60 [[Second]]s
			- Because teams don’t have control over what sector they’re required to capture, it never really made sense to delegate specific resources to a sector. Resource gain tied to sector control created a compounding imbalance the further the attacking team pushed the defenders back, causing a steamroll.
		- When a sector is captured the team capturing gains 25 of each [[Resource]] , the team losing loses 25 of each resource. This represents a non-compounding benefit/loss to the gaining or losing of a sector to prevent steamrolling but still reward [[Victory]] or [[Defeat]] in a sector.
		- Changed the [[Encouraged]] ability to double [[Ambient resource generation]] for 5 minutes (300 [[Second]]s)
			- This was required to bring the ability in line with the resource changes.
		- Changed [[Offensive mode]] active sectors from 2 to 1
		- Balanced starting [[Resource]]s
		- Increased [[Commander ability]] costs
		- Reduced [[Team]] limit on [[Resource node]]s from 4 to 3
		- Increased [[Manpower]] bleed during [[Overtime]] from -1 to -5 to reflect new [[Resource]] values
