- Animation
	- FPP
		- Our entire first person perspective animations have been overhauled in two ways - first in all the underlying systems, and then in the way the specific animations look. You can read more about this in the specific [[Developer Briefing]] [here](https://steamcommunity.com/games/686810/announcements/detail/2536038699697837955?snr=1_2108_9__2107).
	- TPP
		- All TPP animations have been overhauled at a systems level in order to make them procedural, as well as at an asset level - to incorporate the use of [[Motion capture]] movements. You can read more about this in the specific [[Developer Briefing]] [here](https://steamcommunity.com/games/686810/announcements/detail/2609223645216778362?snr=1_2108_9__2107).
	- Sound
		- All TPP and FPP firearms sounds have been overhauled. The full details can be read here, in [our sound-specific Developer Briefing](https://steamcommunity.com/games/686810/announcements/detail/2609223645216778362?snr=1_2108_9__2107).
- [[Carentan]] (including [[Warfare mode]] and [[Offensive mode]] for [[US]])
	- Carentan is our first majority-urban map.  You can read more about Carentan the specific [Developer Briefing](https://steamcommunity.com/games/686810/announcements/detail/2536038699672860181?snr=1_2108_9__2107).
	- The sheer density of the map has been a huge challenge to optimise, and while we have made many large scale improvements to the performance, there are key aspects of optimisation that we are now working to improve. Over the course of [[Early Access]] Carentan will receive the same continued attention as all other maps as we seek to improve frame rates across the board.
- [[Foy]] Overhaul
	- Both Foy game modes have received a photoreal lighting pass, including a change to all atmospherics.
	- Foy itself has had nearly every [[Strongpoint]] assessed and revised based on [[Feedback]] and player experience within the game. All are overhauled - to provide either a visual upgrade, fix collision bugs or improve gameplay.
	- We’re working to create variation of experience in each location across the map, as well as maintaining open fields for [[Vehicle]] movement. Cover density has hugely increased too, while map flow has been revised to allow for better armored encounters and easier placement of [[Spawn]] points.
- [[Omaha Beach]] Partial Overhaul
	- While more work is still to be done on Omaha, many locations - including [[Vierville]] and outlying [[Strongpoint]]s - have had a significant rework to include new assets - including more optimised and gameplay friendly [[Structure]]s and layouts.
	- Omaha has also been re-lit to better build the mood of the fated morning.
	- More work will be done to Omaha during the course of Early Access.
- [[Metagame]] Changes
	- We’ve listened to all the feedback regarding [[Garrison]] bombing and the dissatisfaction with the metagame. Our design policy is to gently move the meta back into line with the outcomes we desire.
	- [[Garrison]]s cannot be placed on [[Neutral territory]] or [[Enemy territory]].
	- We are delineating the usage of [[Garrison]]s to be positions behind the front that are designed to feed attacks and defensive locations, as opposed to functioning as a “bomb” or the tip of the spear in the assault. To this end, [[Outpost]] s will now function as they are intended - as faster forward spawns used by assault units. Our desire here is to encourage more intentional offensive and defensive behaviour around a defined front line, as opposed to just dropping a Garrison and flooding the point. We feel this will make defending far easier as it is less likely that a defensive unit will be attacked from any direction.
	- [[Enemy]] [[Garrison]]s now take 5 [[Second]]s to be dismantled
		- This replaces the proximity takedown, as the opportunity cost of removing a Garrison was too easy and low previously. To counter any [[spawn]] camping this may encourage, we’ve made additional changes below.
	- Players cannot spawn on a [[Garrison]] if an [[Enemy]] player is within 15 [[Metres]]
		- Garrisons now lock spawning if an enemy is within close range and moving to dismantle it. This will reduce mass [[Spawn]] -killing, as well as incentivise the attacking player to close the distance to remove the Garrison.
	- Minimum distance between friendly [[Garrison]]s is now 100 [[Metres]]
		- This change is to enable more even placement behind the [[Front line]] and give more contingency should a key Garrison go down.
	- [[Outpost]] cooldown has been reduced to 120 [[Second]]s in order to allow players to maintain them
		- In order to effectively assault into [[Enemy territory]], OPs are now able to be placed far more frequently.
	- Sector [[Capture time]] is now reduced to 120 [[Second]]s
		- In order to create more decisive conflicts on the point, we’ve slightly lowered the total time to capture the point. We found that in [[Offensive mode]] particularly, the contested nature of flags as well as the total time needed to capture them meant that games could run well over 2 hours (7200 [[Second]]s), resulting in tedious gameplay and lack any decisive [[Victory]] or [[Defeat]].
	- As always, we’ll be monitoring all of these changes and the way they affect the flow of the gameplay. We are currently preparing two significant meta-changing new features: [[Transport vehicle]]s and [[Support]]/ [[Engineer]] changes and are keen to make these adjustments before these hit the battlefield. We’ve also added the new "[[Airhead]]" [[Commander ability]] (details below) in order to enable each force better strategic ability to mitigate [[Breakthrough]]s or strike into [[Enemy territory]].
- [[Teamkill]]s
	- Team Kill penalties now stack. Additional TKs will extend your next redeploy time by 10 [[Second]]s for each teamkill.
- [[Redeploy]]
	- Using the Redeploy function on the In-Game [[Menu]] now has a 20 [[Second]]s redeploy time
	- All self-inflicted [[Damage]] that leads to death, now gives a redeploy time of 20 [[Second]]s
- New [[Commander ability]]
	- [[Airhead]]
		- A bridgehead established by aerial drops - often into enemy territory. In Hell Let Loose, an Airhead can be established by the [[Commander]] at any location of their choice.
		- After using the ability, your [[Team]]-specific supply [[Plane]] will drop a temporary Airhead spawn point at the target location.
		- [[Cost]]: 75 [[Manpower]]
		- [[Cooldown]]: 600 [[Second]]s
		- All [[Infantry squad]] and [[Recon squad]] players can spawn on it.
		- Players can [[Spawn]] on it every 30 seconds for 120 [[Second]]s minutes (approximately four spawn waves).
		- Be careful when dropping the Airhead into [[Enemy territory]] - as enemy presence can destroy it immediately - rendering it useless.
		- Unlike the new [[Garrison]] changes, the Airhead is destroyed by enemy proximity.
		- Recommended Uses:
			- Use with coordinated Units to effectively flank and deep strike into [[Enemy territory]] .
			- Use to save a collapsing front line.
- Patch Changelist
	- Gameplay
		- Introduced the ability to use your mouse and turn your head in vehicle viewports. We have parented hull machine-guns to this movement to enable a smooth firing/looking experience. Please note that viewports will be overhauled to re-introduce both depth of field effects and much higher texture detail.
		- We will also be changing the hull and coaxial MGs in vehicles to use the ballistics system now that we’ve profiled performance costs.
		- MG’s can now be deployed while the player is still moving, instead of requiring the player to stop moving first.
		- The M1 Garand can now be reloaded mid-clip.
		- Hovering on any Unit Officers on the map highlights all of their Unit members.
		- Vehicle name plates to only show when pointed.
		- We now show the health status of Unit members in the member list on the HUD: Unit members appear white when alive in-game, grey when dead/in the deployment menu, and Red when in critical state in all listed locations.
		- Every weapon now has a recoil pattern that can be mastered.
		- Introduced new ways for experience to be gained. Eg. experience is rewarded for placing the ammo box, as well as for each time the ammo box is used by another player.
		- Added gameplay option to hide vote kick notifications
		- Unit list automatically expands in the deploy menu when you join or create a Unit.
		- Implemented an autosprint. Players can autosprint by double tapping the W key. We will refine and expand this functionality for U8.
		- When a player is crouched, enable the pressing of the space bar to stand them up.
		- Force dominance to going ADS while crawling.
		- When pressing jump while prone, transition the player to crouch.
	- [[Performance]]
		- Continual performance updates across all aspects of the title.
		- Lowered dead body despawn rate to 30 seconds as default.
		- Please note: we have many aspects of [[Optimisation]]s still to come. Now that U7 has been released, we will be focusing our efforts on this in the near future.

	- Visual Improvements
		- [[Suppression]] has been reworked to optimise the visual effects, make the blur far less ugly while still maintaining the intended effect. Previously, it was very difficult to determine whether you had been wounded as the suppression would darken your screen. We’ve worked hard to distinguish these two states.
		- The “bloody screen” wounded overlay is now far more distinct and obvious. As your wounds become more severe and stay untreated, the pumping heartbeat sound will pulse with the overlay and become faster and faster.
		- When killed by small-arms, your player [[Camera]] will tumble much faster to the ground in line with the momentum of your body. Previously it would float down to the ground.
		- Overhauled [[Camera]] shakes when firing weapons to be calibre-specific
		- Overhauled [[Camera]] shakes when explosions occur nearby (including while in a tank).
		- Reworked [[Gore]] and dismemberment. Many features were not working as intended - including blood trails, fx and better visuals. This has all been fixed.
		- Fixed: The Colt M1911 and Luger P08 will display a bullet model inside the chamber even though the gun is currently empty
		- Fixed: No rotating animation present on the player in the second seat of the artillery
		- Temporarily disabled map vote function as it was non-functional and visually irritating. We will be introducing a much nicer end-of-round map vote function in [[Update 8]].

	-
	- Known Issues
		- Some HLOD issues exist in [[Carentan]] (the buildings that appear to be “melted ice-cream”) and some other maps. We’ll be focusing on addressing these issues shortly.
		- Some collision issues exist in [[Carentan]] - we will be fixing these shortly.
		- We’re aware of some bugs causing small ditches in specific locations of [[Omaha Beach]] .
		- The blurring effect during [[Suppression]] is currently at an unintended low intensity, and will be increased back to normal levels shortly. This was introduced accidentally when reworking the suppression visual effects.
		- The [[Zeroing]] on many weapons currently sits at 0m. We will be fixing this shortly.
		- We temporarily needed to remove the player’s own FPP shadow as it was continuously casting shadow on the player rig no matter the angle or orientation. We’ll be revisiting this.
		- We’re aware of the [[FPS]] “hitch” that can occur every couple of minutes for some players. We have a fairly good idea of what is causing this and will be giving it a lot of attention moving forward.
		- As with all huge infrastructure changes, we do expect both server and client [[Crash]]es to increase in frequency. We are committed to isolating and fixing these as soon as possible, and are very thankful with your patience as we iron these out.
	- Currently Working On (in no specific order)

		- [[Tank crewman]] functionality.
		- Continued refinement of TPP animation systems (to iron out any issues presented in U7, and to build in greater procedural cycles).
		- Overhauling [[Ammo box]] and supply types - including the [[Support]] and [[Logistics]] gameplay loop.
